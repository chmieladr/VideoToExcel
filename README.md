# VideoToExcel

Simple Python script to convert a video with consistent dataflow to an Excel file. Utilises the following packages:
- `opencv-python` - video processing
- `openpyxl` - Excel file creation
- `pandas` - data manipulation
- `pillow` - image processing
- `pytesseract` - reading text from images

**Note:** Due to the nature of `pytesseract`, some information might be skipped and/or misread. This is especially true for images with low contrast or small text.
